          <p>I was the Team Captain for this competition as well as one of the penetration testers. In total, there were five people on the team. I would like to thank Ryan, Luke, Daniel, and Charles for pushing yourselves and staying up doing research on top of having coursework as well.</p>

<p>Thank you for being such great teammates. Our team name was Iterative Security; the reason I chose this name was that I liked the meaning behind it: that we grow and improve through each mistake, each engagement, and each iteration of the tasks that we face. Overall, we were tasked with performing a penetration test for a company named PNVI Labs.</p>

<p>This network was segmented into two sections: the Research and Development Network and the Corporate Network. Our Kali machines could only reach the Corporate Network, so it was up to us to figure out how to get to the Research and Development Network. Once the engagement was done, we were tasked with completing a report consisting of the vulnerabilities and exploits found in the network. We were also tasked with determining the risks of each of these exploits and vulnerabilities, which we would then present in front of the judges. Given that all of our teammates were new to penetration testing we managed to get first place in the competition over other teams that ranged from different Universities.</p>

<p>The following are the steps we took throughout the engagement. The link to our report can also be found within this post as well.</p>

<p>Special thank you to Alex, Dylan, Brice, Taylor and the Missa Team for making this competition possible, and giving students a simulation of what a real world engagement would be like.</p>
