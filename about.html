    <p>I'm a fourth-year Computer Science major with a minor in Computer Information Systems at Cal Poly Pomona. Currently, I'm working as an IT Support Technician for the City of Glendale and am learning new skills in cybersecurity, software engineering, and game development.</p>
    <p>My passion for offensive security has led me to compete in cybersecurity competitions, tackle HackTheBox challenges, and dive into malware development and analysis. I plan to document my journey and am working toward professional certifications. My current goals include earning the <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security" target="_blank">CompTIA Security+</a>, <a href="https://training.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/courses/red-team-ops" target="_blank">Red Team Ops 1</a>, and ultimately the <a href="https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/" target="_blank">OSCP</a> where only those who try harder earn this certificate.</p>
    <p>I plan to update this blog with any new projects I am working on. Currently, I have been focusing on <a href="DLLInjection.md">DLL Injection</a>.</p>
